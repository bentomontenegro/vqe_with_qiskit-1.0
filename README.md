### Introduction

Here you can find a series of Jupyter Notebooks introducing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) from its very foundations with qiskit 1.0x (latest release). 

Hopefully it will provide a good starting point for beginners in their journey with quantum algorithms and qiskit. I intend to constantly update this repository, so keep an eye out for more.

### Today's files

- **The Variational Method in Quantum Mechanics (pdf)**: A detailed tutorial covering all the basic theory behind VQE. Background needed: basic quantum mechanics
- **A beginner-friendly implementation of VQE with qiskit 1.0x, Part 1 (ipynb)**: Implementing VQE to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian H = Z.
- **A beginner-friendly implementation of VQE with qiskit 1.0x, Part 2 (ipynb)**: Implementing VQE to find the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H = Z - X.
- **A beginner-friendly implementation of VQE with qiskit 1.0x, Part 3 (ipynb)**: The same cases of the last Notebooks but with more advanced and scalable(!) tools, like functions and SciPy optimizers.
