Here you can find a set of Notebooks introducing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) from its very foundations with qiskit 1.0x (latest release). Hopefully it will furnish beginners a good starting point in their journey with quantum algorithms and qiskit 1.0x.

I intend to constantly update this repository, so keep an eye out for more. Today you can find:

### A beginner-friendly implementation of the VQE with qiskit 1.0 (Part 1)
  Implementing VQE to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian H = Z.
### A beginner-friendly implementation of the VQE with qiskit 1.0 (Part 2)
  Implementing VQE to find the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H = Z - X.
### A beginner-friendly implementation of the VQE with qiskit 1.0 (Part 3)
  The same cases of the last Notebooks but with more advanced tools, like functions and SciPy optimizers.
